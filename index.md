title: Philosophy is cool
---

**Philosophy is cool** is an open-source, interactive, online "text"book for Introduction to Philosophy courses. PIC was built on resources authored by Christina Hendricks. It is edited by [Christina Hendricks](http://blogs.ubc.ca/christinahendricks). 

Major funding and technological support (including the building of the technology behind the interactive music notation modules found in this text) came from the team at [Trinket](http://www.trinket.io).

The first major edition of OMT was made possible financially by [a crowdfunding campaign](http://www.hybridpedagogy.com/page-two/open-interactive-music-theory-textbook-campaign-update/) in the summer of 2014. Many thanks to the donors who supported the project (listed on the [about](about.html) page).
